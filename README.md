**Sentiment Classification with LSTM on Apple MPS**

This Jupyter Notebook implements a sentiment classifier using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in PyTorch. It's designed for Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) for efficient execution.

**Key Features:**

- **Simple Data Processing:** Leverages basic text cleaning techniques, making the code easy to understand without relying on external libraries like spaCy or NLTK.
- **LSTM-based Model:** Employs LSTMs to capture sequential dependencies within text, improving sentiment analysis accuracy.
- **PyTorch Implementation:** Utilizes PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, for building and training the sentiment classifier.
- **Apple MPS Compatibility:** Optimized to leverage the power of Apple MPS for hardware-accelerated performance on Apple devices.

**Project Context:**

This Jupyter Notebook was created as an exercise to solidify the concepts presented in a section of the Introduction to PyTorch Udacity course. It implements a sentiment classifier using an LSTM network architecture in PyTorch, with optimizations for Apple MPS. The code presented here deviates slightly from the instructor's provided example and network structure, reflecting the author's attempt to modernize the implementation. 

**Feel free to explore and adapt this code for your own sentiment analysis tasks!**
